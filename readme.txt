Hello! Welcome to my final project!

I made a turn based survival game for my final project.
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by avoiding the enemies.
Every turn you survive you score will increase.
Everytime you end a turn on the same square as the enemy you lose 1 life. If you lose all 3 the game is over.
You (the player) are the "X" while the enemies are the "0"s.
There are two power ups, the freeze and the sheild. Each one can only be used once per game so use them wisely!
The power ups also run out after a certain ammount of turns.
The freeze is the "F" on the board and the shield is the "S".

To run the game just run the Startgame.py file.
At the start you will need to put in a name and choose a difficulty.
The difficulty does not effect the enemies but it makes the board smaller.
Have fun!
